# 16S_microbiome_analysis

This is a repository that contains common R scripts I use to analyze 16S amplicon data.

The data should already be process from raw reads/fastq through to a count table and taxonomy table before using these scripts.

Currently the scripts cover generating: 

* bar plots 

* ordination plots

* box and whisker plots.

All required packages and files are listed within each script.

Example plots that I exported from the provided articial.count.table.csv are provided in the test_plots directory.
